            <p>
                Computer programming is the process of writing instructions that get executed by computers. The instructions, 
                also known as code, are written in a programming language which the computer can understand and use to perform a task or 
                solve a problem.

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>
                Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. 
                Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to 
                baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions.
                <br><br>
                Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks. Cooking is done both by people in their 
                own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
